# Customer Behavior Analysis — E-commerce Segmentation & Churn BI

This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics and business intelligence project focused on understanding customer purchasing patterns, segmenting users, and identifying primary drivers of customer churn. This project is a submission for the **InternSpark Data Analytics Internship at Alfido Tech**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview & Objective

The primary objective is to transform raw e-commerce transaction data into a strategic business intelligence asset. By analyzing customer behaviors, transaction histories, returns, and payment preferences, we aim to:
1. Identify primary risk factors driving customer churn.
2. Segment the customer base using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling to enable targeted marketing.
3. Formulate data-backed, actionable business recommendations to improve customer lifetime value (CLV) and retention for Alfido Tech.

## 🚀 Installation & Reproducibility

To replicate the analysis, run the notebook, or generate the PDF report locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the `uv` tool installed (or standard `python` and `pip`).

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment & Install Dependencies
Clone the repository and install packages from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Behavior-Analysis.git
cd Customer-Behavior-Analysis

# Initialize a virtual environment and install packages
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Pipeline
To download the dataset, execute data cleaning, generate plots, compile the PDF, and create the pre-executed notebook:
```bash
# Download dataset
uv run python scratch/download_data.py

# Run complete analysis
uv run python scratch/run_analysis.py
```

## 📈 Analysis Workflow & Results

### 1. Data Cleaning Decisions
* **Redundancy:** Dropped `Customer Age` as it was identical to the `Age` column.
* **Missing Values:** Imputed 47,596 missing values in the `Returns` column as `0` (No Return), avoiding dropping 19% of the records.
* **Types:** Converted dates to datetime objects, and flags (`Returns`, `Churn`) to integers.
* **Standardization:** Stripped spaces and converted category values to Title Case.

### 2. Feature Engineering
We generated:
* `Total Spending` = `Product Price * Quantity`
* `Customer Lifetime Value` (CLV) = Sum of transactions per customer.
* `Average Order Value` (AOV) = Average spent per transaction per customer.
* `Purchase Frequency` = Total orders per customer.
* `Recency` = Days since last purchase relative to the max date.
* `Customer Age Group` = Binned ages (`Under 25`, `25-34`, `35-44`, `45-54`, `55-64`, `65+`).

### 3. Customer Segments (RFM Profile)

| Segment | Recency (d) | Frequency | CLV ($) | AOV ($) | Return % | Churn % |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **High Value (Champions)** | 114.7 | 8.35 | $2,965.73 | $355.20 | 40.5% | 19.7% |
| **Loyal Customers** | 204.0 | 6.55 | $2,425.43 | $370.29 | 40.2% | 20.3% |
| **New Customers** | 98.7 | 1.94 | $811.23 | $418.16 | 40.4% | 20.7% |
| **At Risk** | 305.8 | 5.56 | $2,076.32 | $373.44 | 40.4% | 19.4% |
| **Lost Customers** | 413.4 | 2.52 | $975.31 | $387.03 | 39.6% | 20.1% |

### 4. Key Churn Indicators
* **Returns:** Customers who returned products have a **23.3%** churn rate, compared to **16.8%** for non-returners.
* **Payment Methods:** Crypto checkouts lead with **20.3%** churn, while Credit Card has the lowest.
* **Transaction drop-off:** 50.6% of customers buy only once, indicating a retention bottleneck at the second purchase.
